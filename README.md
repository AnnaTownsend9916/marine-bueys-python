# marine-bueys-python
A project that finds data from the Northern Lake bueys and the Canadian bueys in the southern lakes. I am collecting my data from a url from a government website. I open the data and turn it into a tsv(tab separated file) and for each row of data I want to call certain data points back. I should be able to see date, windspeed, airtemp, and water temp for either Northern or Southern data I get back. I should also be able to decide how many rows out of the data I would like to see
